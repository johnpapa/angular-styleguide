# Angular 2 Style Guide
Style Guides require experience building applications with the tools. My style guide for Angular 1 was based on years of experience with Angular 1, collaboration with other Angular experts, and contributions from the Angular core team. Nobody has the equivalent  massive experience with Angular 2, and thus the Angular 2 Style Guide is a work in progress.

My intent is to release the guide as a living document. Guidelines that we are comfortable recommending will be included. Be wary and definitely ask questions when someone, including me, publishes a guide :)

## Angular Team Endorsed
Special thanks to Igor Minar, lead on the Angular team, for reviewing, contributing feedback, and entrusting me to shepherd this guide.

## Purpose
*Opinionated Angular style guide for teams by [@john_papa](//twitter.com/john_papa)*

If you are looking for an opinionated style guide for syntax, conventions, and structuring Angular applications, then step right in. These styles are based on development experience with [Angular](//angularjs.org), presentations, [Pluralsight training courses](http://app.pluralsight.com/author/john-papa) and working in teams.

The purpose of this style guide is to provide guidance on building Angular applications by showing the conventions I use and, more importantly, why I choose them.

## Relocating the Angular 2 Style Guide 
The Angular 2 Style Guide has been moved to the [Official Angular 2 docs](http://jpapa.me/ng2styleguide). I will still be shepherding the guide there. It is a living guide ... we'll keep evolving the guide.
